[{"name":"Restaurant North, Market North; Armonk, N.Y.","description":"One of the Hudson Valley's best farm-to-table restaurants. Owned by two alums from Danny Meyer's restaurant empire, Restaurant North serves the best local ingredients prepared by the talented James Beard Award-nominated chef Eric Gabrynowicz. The menu changes depending on what's in season, but always expect to see a cut of pork and beautiful tender greens. The white-tablecloth setting is serene and the service is flawless. For a more casual version, where you can get sandwiches and salads to go, head across the street to Market North, the little sister cafe.","detour":"Not five minutes off I-684.
